     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

      This Source Code Form is subject to the
      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
      2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not
      distributed with this file, You can
      obtain one at
      http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

      This Source Code Form is “Incompatible
      With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by
      the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

 1. Definitions.

    "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
    and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

    "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
    the copyright owner that is granting the License.

    "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
    other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
    control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
    "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
    exercising permissions granted by this License.

    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
    including but not limited to software source code, documentation
    source, and configuration files.

    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
    and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
    identification within third-party archives.

    <ul><p>1.2 Interpretation</p>

        <p>In these Terms (including the introduction and schedules) unless the
            context otherwise requires:</p>

        <ul><p>(a) reference to a person includes a legal person (such as a limited
            company) as well as a natural person;</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(b) reference to these Terms includes the schedules and appendices and other
            documents attached to it or incorporated by reference into it (all as
            amended, added to or replaced from time to time);</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(c) references to clauses or schedules shall be to those in or to these
            Terms and references to paragraphs shall be to paragraphs of the
            schedules or annexes to the schedules (as the case may be);</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(d) clause headings are for convenience only and shall not affect the
            construction of these Terms;</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(e) reference to "<strong>including</strong>" or any similar terms in these Terms shall
            be treated as being by way of example and shall not limit the general
            applicability of any preceding words; and</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(f) reference to any legislation shall be to that legislation as amended,
            extended or re-enacted from time to time and to any subordinate
            provision made under that legislation.</p></ul>
    </ul>

    <li value="2"><p><strong>Provision of Licensed Materials and Support Services</strong></p></li>

    <ul><p>2.1 The Licensor shall make the Licensed Materials available in Source Code
        form (along with any login details and an activation key required to
        use the Licensed Materials), following payment of the Licence Fees.</p></ul>

    <ul><p>2.2 Subject to clause 2.3 the Licensor grants to the Licensee and its
        Affiliate(s) a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
        non-sublicensable, royalty-free licence, commencing on the Effective
        Date, to permit Licensee Developers to use the Licensed Materials in
        accordance with the terms of these Terms, subject to the limit on the
        number of permitted Licensee Developers set out in the Order. Members
        within the group of Licensee Developers can be replaced with alternative
        members as long as the number of Licensee Developers at any time does
        not exceed the limit set out in the Order as the "Number of Licensee
        Developers". For the purposes of this limit, each developer modifying
        JavaScript Code as part of the creation of an Application or
        Modification shall constitute a separate Licensee Developer. For
        example, if the Licensee has five developers working with JavaScript on
        an Application, but only two developers directly working with the
        Software, all five developers will be counted as Licensee Developers.</p></ul>

    <ul><p>2.3 Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, if the Order specifies
        that this is a Deployment Licence then:</p>

        <ul><p>(a) the licence granted in clause 2.2 shall be sub-licensable and subject to
            the limit on the number of permitted Production Environment(s) set out
            in the Order;</p><p></p></ul>

        <ul><p>(b) subject to this clause 2.3 and clause 2.4(b), the Deployment Licence
            shall be subject to the same applicable licence restrictions as set out
            in these Terms; and</p><p></p></ul>

        <ul><p>(c) the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) shall ensure that the terms of any
            sub-licence are in writing and are substantially the same as the terms
            of these Terms (except that the sub-licensee shall not have the right to
            sub-licence its rights).</p></ul></ul>

    <ul><p>2.4 The Licensee and its Affiliate(s) may use the Licensed Materials to
        install, load, launch, access, run, execute, operate, and archive the
        Licensed Materials for production, test, archival, emergency re-start
        and disaster recovery purposes and to develop and create derivative
        works from the Licensed Materials in the form of Applications, provided
        that:</p>

        <ul><p>(a) the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) may not create more than one
            Application if a single application developer license is specified on
            the Order (provided that new versions and different editions of an
            Application shall be considered, for the purposes of the number of
            permitted Applications, to be the same as the original Application as
            long as they are in the same evolutionary line). For the avoidance of
            doubt, Licensee and its Affiliate(s) may create an unlimited number of
            Applications if a multiple applications developer license is specified
            on the Order;</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(b) unless the Order specifies that this is a Deployment Licence, any
            Application created must be used for the Licensee's internal business
            purposes only and must not be licensed to third parties; and</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(c) the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) shall not permit any end user of any
            Application to use the Software independently of, or by or with any
            applications other than, the Application being used by that end user.</p></ul>

        <p>Any reference in this clause 2 to "use" of the Licensed Materials shall
            be deemed to include any and all of the foregoing.</p></ul>

    <ul><p>2.5 For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensee shall be permitted to create
        Modifications to the Source Code to the Software for the Licensee's use
        of the Software in accordance with these Terms. In the event that the
        Licensee creates any Modifications to the Source Code to the Software,
        the Licensor shall not be obliged to provide the Support Services in
        relation to any such Modification(s) from the date on which any such
        Modification(s) take place.</p></ul>

    <ul><p>2.6 The Licensee and its Affiliate(s) shall not change or remove the
        copyright notice from any of the files included in the Licensed
        Materials.</p></ul>

    <ul><p>2.7 The Licensee and its Affiliate(s) shall not redistribute the Licensed
        Materials or any Modifications other than as expressly permitted by
        these Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensee shall not
        redistribute the Licensed Materials or any Modifications:</p>

        <ul><p>(a) other than by including the Software or a portion of the Software within
            Application(s); and</p></ul><p></p>

        <ul><p>(b) as part of any Application that can be described as a development
            toolkit or library, an application builder, a website builder, a user
            interface designer, or any application that is intended for use by
            software, application, or website developers or designers, or has a
            similar purpose or functionality (as determined by the Licensor).</p></ul></ul>

    <ul><p>2.8 Subject to clause 2.5, the Licensor will provide the Support Services in
        accordance with schedule 1 from the Effective Date.</p></ul>

    <li><p><strong>Price of Licensed Materials and payment</strong></p></li>

    <ul><p>3.1 The Licence Fees payable will be as set out on the Site at the time the
        Licensee submits its Order. Payment of the Licence Fees is in advance
        and must be made by credit or debit card on the checkout page on the
        Site. The Licensor accepts payment by most major credit and debit cards.
        Payment for the Licence Fees will be automatically taken from the
        Licensee's selected payment method.</p></ul>

    <ul><p>6.1 The Licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Licensor
        against all Losses that the Licensor incurs or suffers as a result of

        and/or Support Services by the Licensee infringes the Intellectual
        Property Rights or other proprietary rights of any third party, provided
        that:</p>

        <ul><p>(a) the Licensee notifies the Licensor in writing as soon as reasonably
            practicable of any claim under clause 6.2 of which the Licensee has
            notice (an "<strong>Indemnified Claim</strong>");</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(b) the Licensee does not admit any liability or agree to any settlement or
            compromise of an Indemnified Claim without the prior written consent of
            the Licensor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(c) the Licensor shall, at any time from notification in accordance with
            clause 6.2(a), at the Licensor's request, cost and expense, be entitled

        the Licensor is obliged to indemnify under clause 6.2, the Licensor may,
        at its discretion, either procure the rights necessary for continued
        receipt, possession and use or promptly carry out such modification or
        replacement as may be necessary to make receipt, possession and use
        non-infringing.</p></ul>

        <p>however arising (whether from breach of contract, tort (including
            negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise), whether or not such
            loss was foreseeable or if the party which would otherwise be liable for
            such loss was advised of its possibility (and, for the purposes of this
            clause 7.2, the term "loss" includes a partial loss or reduction in
            value as well as a complete or total loss).</p></ul>

    <ul><p>7.3 Subject to clauses 7.1 and 7.2, the Licensor's total liability arising
        out of or relating to these Terms or its subject matter and to anything
        which it has done or not done in connection with the same (whether from
        breach of contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory
        duty or otherwise) shall be limited, in aggregate for all claims
        arising, to the greater of: (a) the total of all amounts payable

        <ul><p>(c) subject to clause 8.2, not disclose such Confidential Information to any
            third party (other than its professional advisers, officers, employees,
            agents, contractors and sub-contractors on a 'need to know' basis as
            strictly required for the purposes of these Terms and subject to each
            such person being bound by an obligation of confidentiality equivalent
            to this clause 8); and</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(d) promptly, upon request and, in any event, upon termination of these

            Confidential Information in its possession or control and, if requested
            by the other party, certify in writing that it has done so.</p></ul></ul>

    <ul><p>8.2 Either party may disclose the other's Confidential Information to the
        extent required by law or by any court, tribunal, regulator or other
        authority with competent jurisdiction to order its disclosure (but only
        to the extent of such requirement), provided that, to the extent
        permitted by law, the party compelled to make such disclosure shall

    <li><p><strong>Data protection</strong></p></li>

    <ul><p>9.1 Each party shall:</p>

        <ul><p>(a) at all times during the term of these Terms, comply with the Data
            Protection Legislation, in case such legislation is applicable to the

        <ul><p>(b) to the extent applicable under the Data Protection Legislation, obtain
            and maintain all appropriate registrations required in order to allow
            that party to perform its obligations under these Terms.</p></ul></ul>

    <ul><p>9.2 In this clause 9, the terms "<strong>personal data</strong>", "<strong>process</strong>" and
        "<strong>processor</strong>" shall have the meanings given in the applicable Data
        Protection Legislation. The parties acknowledge that the types of
        personal data processed pursuant to these Terms (including the subject
        matter, duration, nature and purpose of the processing and the
        categories of data subject) are as described in schedule 2. In relation
        to all personal data provided or made available to the Licensor by or on
        behalf of the Licensee, the Licensor:</p><p>

            the Licensee's instructions issued from time to time;</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(c) shall immediately inform the Licensee if, in the Licensor's opinion, any
            instructions given to it by the Licensee in relation to the processing
            of such personal data under these Terms infringe any Data Protection
            Legislation;</p></ul>

            <ul><p>(i) the protection of the rights of the relevant data subjects; and</p></ul>

            <ul><p>(ii) a level of security appropriate to the risks that are presented by any
                processing of such personal data, in particular protection from
                accidental loss or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised
                disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or
                otherwise processed by the Licensor pursuant to these Terms;</p></ul></ul>

        <ul><p>(f) shall not engage any sub-processor without the prior written consent of
            the Licensee and then only on the basis of a written contract between
            the Licensor and the sub-processor which imposes on the sub-processor
            terms equivalent to the provisions of this clause 9. The Licensor shall
            be responsible for the management of any permitted sub-processor and its
            compliance with such terms and shall be directly liable to the Licensee
            for any breach of the same;</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(g) shall notify the Licensee without undue delay of any breach of the
            provisions of this clause 9 and provide assistance to the Licensee in

        <ul><p>(h) shall provide timely cooperation and assistance to the Licensee in
            ensuring compliance with:</p>

            <ul><p>(i) the Licensee's obligations to respond to any complaint or request form
                any applicable data protection authority or data subjects seeking to

            <ul><p>(ii) the Licensee's obligations set out under Articles 32 - 36 of the GDPR
                to:</p>

                <ul><p>(A) ensure the security of the processing;</p></ul>

                <ul><p>(B) notify the relevant supervisory authority and any data subjects, where

                <ul><p>(C) carry out any data protection impact assessments ("<strong>DPIA</strong>") on the
                    impact of the processing on the protection of personal data; and</p></ul>

                <ul><p>(D) consult the relevant supervisory authority prior to any processing where

        <ul><p>(i) shall make available to the Licensee all information reasonably required
            by the Licensee to demonstrate the Licensor's compliance with its
            obligations set out in this clause 9 and allow and participate in any

            another auditor mandated by the Licensee.</p></ul></ul>

    <li><p><strong>Term</strong></p></li>

    These Terms shall commence on the Effective Date and shall, unless
    sooner terminated in accordance with its terms, continue for an initial
    term of 12 months ("<strong>Initial Term</strong>"), when it shall terminate
    automatically without notice unless, no later than 1 month before the
    end of the Initial Term (or any Extended Term agreed under this clause),
    the parties agree in writing that the term of these Terms shall be
    extended for a period of 12 months (each an "<strong>Extended Term</strong>"). Unless
    it is further extended under this clause 10 or terminated earlier in
    accordance with these Terms, these Terms shall terminate automatically

        <ul><p>(b) the other materially breaches any term of these Terms and it is possible
            to remedy that breach, but the other fails to do so within 30 days of

        <ul><p>(c) the other suffers or undergoes an Insolvency Event; or</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(d) the other is delayed in performing its obligations under these Terms
            under clause 13 for a period of 30 days or more.</p></ul>

        <p>For the purposes of this clause 11.1, in order for it to be possible to
            remedy a breach it must be possible to take steps so as to put the other
            party into the same position which (save as to the date) it would have
            been in if the breach had never occurred.</p></ul>

    <li><p><strong>Consequences of termination</strong></p></li>

    <ul><p>12.1 Termination of these Terms for any reason will not affect:</p>

        <ul><p>(a) any accrued rights or liabilities which either party may have by the

        <ul><p>(b) the coming into force or the continuation in force of any of its
            provisions that expressly or by implication are intended to come into
            force or continue in force on or after termination. Without prejudice to
            the foregoing, clauses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 14 shall survive
            termination of these Terms.</p></ul></ul>

    <li><p><strong>Force majeure</strong></p></li>
